# Changelog

One version for the whole workspace (`agentlife`, `lane-restart`, `lane-state`).

## 0.11.4

- A launched lane no longer inherits the spawner's `LANE_ROLE`. `lane-restart`'s role resolution
  lets `LANE_ROLE` win over the cwd leaf, so a lane started by a peer (the PM running
  `lane-restart --role x`, or `agentlife restore` from a lane's shell) used to write the
  spawner's role file instead of its own. `lane-restart`'s `spawn_launch` (both the `wt.exe` and
  the `conhost.exe` command) and agentlife's `RealSpawner` (via `TabLaunch.env_set`) now set
  `LANE_ROLE` to the launched role.

## 0.11.3

- `write_atomic` (used by the registry, the process index, pending restores, frozen plans and
  restore reports) now writes through `persistant` 0.4.1 (crates.io): its blocking `fs` store with
  a per-call scratch directory beside the target's directory, removed before the call returns, so
  an abandoned write cannot leave a temp file behind.
- Cost: each write starts persistant's worker thread and runtime. Measured at about 11 ms per
  write against about 4 ms for the previous temp-and-rename (release build, 1.5 KB files, 200
  writes per round, Windows). The most frequent caller, the registry, writes a few records per
  hook event, or about 20 in one fleet command, so no caller approaches one write per second.
- `is_temp_name` is kept only to skip `.<name>.tmp.<pid>.<n>` files the previous writer left
  beside their targets.
